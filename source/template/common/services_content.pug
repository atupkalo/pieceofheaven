                        Cremation is chosen by many families and individuals as an altemative to traditional burial.
                        However, cremation often follows a traditional funeral service. It is selected for many reasons
                        ranging from religious beliefs or ethnic customs to cost. There are a variety of options for
                        the final disposition of cremated remains. Urns or other containers may be placed in a niche
                        at a columbarium, a structure or room designed to contain cremated remains.
                    p.
                        Families may elect to bury the urn in a family plot or cemetery or keep it in another
                        place of personal significance, such as the home. It is helpful to consider all the options and
                        take the time to ask questions before making a final decision about such an important event.
                        One of our licensed funeral directors will help answer any question you may have.
                        Making an informed choice can help assure peace of mind for everyone involved
